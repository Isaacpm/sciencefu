Sciencefu planning and defitinition

The files contained in this git repository and their description are:
Experiment_Flow:
  Flow of a experiment from start to finish, detailing each step that must be completed to move forward and finish     the experiment. The steps are based on the scientific method and will set the framework for students to learn the    necessary steps to successfuly complete a scientific experiment.

Experiments:
  A small description of the experiments that are planned to be done, this is only to ensure the application will be   able to handle them.  The application should be experiment independent and allow any experiment to be completed      using it, but this being a pilot we want to make sure the experiments will be supported.

Learning_Goals:
  Description of learning goals. Learning goals will be reinforced by how the application is built and the flow of     the experiments. We want to make sure the learning goals align with the ones expected by the teachers.

Units:
  Description of available measurement units in the application, in support of the experiments to be done. Any unit    required for this pilot should be listed here. Additions will be possible later, but would be good to have the most   useful ones from the start.

For further discussions a slack channel is available:
https://sciencefu.slack.com
We encourage that requests, comments, discussions, etc... are done via slack.
Direct email, which you should have, will also work.
